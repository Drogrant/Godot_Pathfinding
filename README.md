# Godot_Pathfinding

Trying to implement A* in Godot. Alternative to Navigation implemented in the engine.

*Description*

The objective is to apply what I've learned about pathfinding and Astar in Godot. Currently I've created a calss which represents some kind of grid and another for the Nodes of the path to follow. Maybe there is a better way to do the grid or the nodes but I'm still learning so any suggestions will be appreciated.
